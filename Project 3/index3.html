    <p class="para">Emulation is a massive selling point of PC for some people. It's a way to experience games they probably wouldn't have played or to replay those game on consoles they don't have anymore. Emulation makes consoles and handhelds obsolete for some people becuase they want one device that can do everything even though there are compromises. It's even a way to enchance modern games as the video on the left shows.</p>

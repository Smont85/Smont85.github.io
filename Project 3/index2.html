    <p class="para">The Switch Lite is disinteresting compared to the other devices in this category. PC handhelds really took off after the Steam Decks release. If you want an overall hassle free experience that is the one to go for, yet other handhelds have great benefits like playing easyanticheat games and different form factors. Some lower powered linux based handhelds even try to compete with the next type of device. Android handhelds are a much more niche variety of device, but I believe they deserve to be mentioned. Android handhelds are mainly used for emulation, but some games have native releases on android. Games like Dead Cells and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/mobile/android/new-device">Fortnite</a> are both available on android. </p>
